## Project Overview
Welcome to the repository for our Healthcare Communication Web Application! This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, key features, technologies used, team skill sets and Progress in the Sprint 1.

## Description
### Software Description
Our project is a web application designed to connect patients and doctors for efficient healthcare communication and services.

### Purpose
The purpose of this software is to facilitate seamless interactions between patients and doctors. It allows patients to post health queries, access medical history records, and receive responses from doctors.

### Uniqueness
This software is unique compared to traditional healthcare software as it focuses on patient-doctor communication, query posting, and maintaining medical history in a user-friendly online platform.

## Use Cases
- **Patient Registration:** Patients can create accounts and log in.
- **Patient posts a query to a doctor:** Patients select a health issue card, get mapped to the corresponding doctor, and click on the "Post Query" button. The query is sent to the doctor, and the patient receives the response when the doctor replies to the query.
- **Patient fills out a health form:** Patients click on the "Fill Out Health Form" button and complete a form that includes their medical history and illness. The form is submitted to the doctor.
- **Doctor posts a response to a patient query:** Doctors click on the "Post Response" button and enter their response to the patient's query. The response is sent to the patient.
- **Patient interacts with the chatbot:** Patients click on the "Chatbot" button and begin a conversation with the chatbot. The chatbot can answer basic questions about the application and provide general health information.
- **Location-Based Recommendation:** Patients click on the "Find Nearest Clinic" button and enter their pincode. The application displays the nearest clinic in the patient's area.

## Users
- **Patients:** They can create accounts, fill the health form that includes medical history, post queries, interact with the chatbot.
- **Doctors:** They can log in, view patient queries, view patient health forms, and post responses to patient queries.

### Key Components
- **Frontend (React):** React powers the frontend, creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.
  - User Login Page
  - Create Account (Sign Up)
  - Patient Home Page
  - Doctor Home Page
- **Backend (Spring Boot):** Spring Boot powers the backend, handling data processing and logic for the application.
  - Chatbot Service
  - Post Query Service
  - Medical History Service
  - Doctor Response Service
  - Search Service
  - User Registration Service
  - Doctor-Patient Interaction Coordination
- **Database:** The database stores all critical application data, ensuring data consistency and privacy.
  - User Account Data
  - Patient and Doctor Information
  - Patient Medical Records
  - Doctor Responses
  - Chatbot Interaction
  - Query and Request Data

## Technologies Used
- **React:** A JavaScript library is used to develop the frontend of the application.
- **Spring Boot:** A Java framework is used to develop the backend of the application.
- **MySQL or Spring Boot in-memory Database:** A relational database management system is used to store data.
- **JIRA:** A project management tool is used to track the progress of the project and manage tasks.

## Team Skill Set
Our team is equipped with a range of skills and proficiencies:

1. Sridurga Kakinada - Proficient in React, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL, and JIRA, making her a valuable asset for frontend and project management tasks.
2. Mahaboob Pasha Mohammad - Skilled in React, Java, and Spring Boot, contributing significantly to both frontend and backend development.
3. Hema Yadav Dokkara - Expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and Docker adds a strong foundation to our backend development and deployment capabilities.
4. Ram Rallapalli - Specializes in backend development, with skills in Java, Spring Boot, and database management, strengthening our backend development efforts.

## Challenges and Risks
1. **Technical Complexities:** Addressing potential technical complexities when implementing new functionalities, including challenges during testing and the risk of not meeting sprint deadlines as planned.
2. **Data Security and Privacy Compliance:** Ensuring the utmost data security and privacy compliance.
3. **Team Coordination:** Coordinating development efforts among team members to maintain efficiency and consistency.
4. **Change Management:** Managing changes effectively and evolving project requirements without disrupting the development flow.

## Sprint 1 Review
Sprint 1 was designed to establish a basis on which the team could efficiently build our healthcare-oriented communications application. The team originally started with three members and later added Ram Rallapalli. Each member brought unique skills and proficiencies to the team.

**Completed Issues & Team Progress:**
- The team made progress in learning new technologies, such as React, and applying them effectively.
- S.K worked on the chatbot and generated responses to user prompts.
- H.Y.D made considerable progress with backend development, fixing connection issues between databases and backends.
- R.R joined as the Scrum master and began learning technologies like Java and Spring Boot.

**Challenges & Learnings:**
- The team underestimated the time needed to learn new technologies, resulting in some bugs and issues towards the end of the sprint.
- The next sprint will focus on resolving these bugs, optimizing code, and developing REST APIs.

## Next Steps
In the upcoming sprints, Team Atom plans to integrate the frontend user interface with the chatbot, optimize code, and develop REST APIs. The team will also focus on better time management
